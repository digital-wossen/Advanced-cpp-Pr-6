/*With gdb I first entered the start command to run it line by line.
Then I used the next command until I got to the find function.
To enter the find function I used the step command.
In the find function I printed i in each iteration using the print command
from that I saw that it was accessing i[nr] which is not supposed to be accessed.
If I enter 0 as the value to be searched even if it doesn't have the element stored in the array
it will return n
This is because it accesses the nth element which is automatically 0.
Also since v has multiple elements the delete command is supposed to be "delete []v" not "delete v"
